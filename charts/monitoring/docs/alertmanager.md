# AlertManager

AlertManager is a component of the Prometheus stack that handles alerts generated by Prometheus. It manages alert notifications and routing.

## Features

- **Alert Routing**: Configurable routing for alerts to different receivers.
- **Silencing**: Supports silencing of alerts to prevent notification spam.
- **Grouping**: Groups similar alerts to reduce noise.

## Configuration

To configure AlertManager, modify the `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
prom-stack:
  alertmanager:
    ingress:
      enabled: false
      ingressClassName: traefik
      hosts:
        - "alertmanager-{{ .Values.global.domain }}"
```

## Usage

AlertManager works with Prometheus to manage alerts. Ensure that Prometheus is configured to send alerts to AlertManager.

## Troubleshooting

- **Notification Issues**: Verify that AlertManager is configured with the correct notification channels.
- **Alert Routing**: Check routing configuration to ensure alerts are being sent to the correct receivers.
